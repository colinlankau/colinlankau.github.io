        <p>Apart from being a computer science student, I enjoy playing soccer.  I have played the sport since I was six, won a state championship in high school, and play collegiate soccer at Arcadia University.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">Aside from soccer, I also enjoy skiing with my family and playing volleyball (I played for two years in high school).  When forced indoors, I enjoy playing video games, and even built my own gaming pc this summer.</p>
